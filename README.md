##Requirement
The code has been tested running under Python 3.7.9. The required packages are as follows:

pytorch == 1.5.0  numpy == 1.15.4  scipy == 1.1.0  sklearn == 0.20.0  torch_scatter == 2.0.5  torch_sparse == 0.6.10  networkx == 2.5

##Useage
The hyper-parameter search range and optimal settings have been clearly stated in the codes (see the parser function in utils/parser.py).

##Train and Test:
'python main.py '
